# React useEffect Cleanup Issue with Rapid Remounts

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React where the cleanup function within a `useEffect` hook might not always be called if the component unmounts and remounts very quickly.  This can lead to memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function is designed to run when a component is unmounted, allowing for resource cleanup (e.g., clearing timers, detaching event listeners). However, if the component is rapidly unmounted and remounted (for example, during rapid navigation or state changes), the cleanup function might not execute properly.

## Solution

The solution involves improving the logic to handle this scenario or preventing rapid remounts in the first place by optimizing the state updates or routing techniques. The example in `bugSolution.js` demonstrates potential solutions like using a flag to manage component mount state.
